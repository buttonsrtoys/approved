## TODO
- swap out the expectWidget for predicate (or finder) in the printExpects command.
- Add "review --all" option that collects all the diffs into a single file for approval
- Add "review path/to/folder" feature that only reviews a results in a single folder
- Add tests for bin/package that write empty .unapproved.txt files and then performs tests on them.
