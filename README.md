## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application.

A few resources to get you started if this is your first Flutter project:

For help getting started with Flutter development, view the
[online documentation](https://docs.flutter.dev/), which offers tutorials,

## TODO
- Approved.tearDownAll could warn users if old .(un)approved.txt files are hanging around.
- Add skip: param.
- dart run approved:clean // deletes the widget names file?
- the stack trace ..._test.dart search should ensure /test/ is in the path
